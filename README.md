Caesar Cipher: A substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of places down or up the alphabet.

Atbash Cipher: A substitution cipher that replaces each letter with its reverse in the alphabet (A ↔ Z, B ↔ Y, etc.).

Baconian Cipher: A method of encoding messages using a binary system where each letter is represented by a group of five characters.

Vigenère Cipher: A method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution based on a keyword.

Playfair Cipher: A digraph substitution cipher that encrypts pairs of letters (bigrams) instead of single letters.

Hill Cipher: A polygraphic substitution cipher based on linear algebra, which uses matrix multiplication for encryption.

Rail Fence Cipher: A transposition cipher that writes the message in a zigzag pattern down and up across multiple "rails" and then reads off each line.

Transposition Cipher: A method of encryption where the positions of the characters are shifted according to a certain system.

Columnar Transposition Cipher: A transposition cipher that arranges the plaintext into a grid and then reads the columns in a specific order.

One-Time Pad: An encryption technique that uses a single-use pre-shared key that is as long as the message being sent, ensuring perfect secrecy.

Substitution Cipher: A method where each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter with some fixed relationship to it.

Morse Code: A method of encoding text characters as sequences of dots and dashes.

Scytale Cipher: An ancient Greek cipher that uses a cylindrical tool to encrypt messages by wrapping a strip of parchment around it.

Enigma Machine: A complex cipher machine used during World War II, employing a series of rotating disks to encrypt messages.

Homophonic Substitution Cipher: A substitution cipher where each plaintext letter can be replaced by multiple ciphertext symbols to make frequency analysis harder.

Bifid Cipher: A combination of a Polybius square and transposition, where the letters are first encoded in a grid and then transposed.

Double Transposition Cipher: A transposition cipher that applies two rounds of transposition to the plaintext.

Affine Cipher: A type of monoalphabetic substitution cipher based on mathematical functions.

Keyword Cipher: A substitution cipher that uses a keyword to create a mixed alphabet for substitution.

Null Cipher: A method of hiding a message within an innocuous text by using specific letters or words to form the hidden message.

Hashing Techniques
MD5 (Message Digest 5): A widely used hash function that produces a 128-bit hash value; commonly used for checksums.

SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1): A cryptographic hash function that produces a 160-bit hash value; considered weak due to vulnerabilities.

SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2): A family of hash functions that includes SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512.

SHA-3 (Secure Hash Algorithm 3): The latest member of the Secure Hash Algorithm family, based on the Keccak algorithm.

RIPEMD-160: A cryptographic hash function that produces a 160-bit hash value, designed as an alternative to SHA-1.

Whirlpool: A cryptographic hash function that produces a 512-bit hash, based on a wide-pipe design.

BLAKE2: A cryptographic hash function that is faster than MD5 and SHA-2 while being secure.

Tiger: A cryptographic hash function designed for speed and efficiency, especially on 64-bit platforms.

Skein: A cryptographic hash function that was a finalist in the SHA-3 competition.

Argon2: A memory-hard hashing function designed for secure password hashing and key derivation.

bcrypt: A password hashing function that incorporates a salt to protect against rainbow table attacks.

scrypt: A password-based key derivation function that is designed to be computationally intensive and memory-hard.

GOST R 34.11: A cryptographic hash function used in Russia, producing a 256-bit hash.

Haval: A variable-length hash function that can produce hash values of different lengths.

FNV (Fowler–Noll–Vo): A non-cryptographic hash
